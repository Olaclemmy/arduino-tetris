# LX' Arduino Tetris

A goal I set for myself for easter 2018: get a Tetris game running on a 32x32 LED matrix panel. This one uses Arduino/Genuino Uno as controller, which is rather limited in memory as I experienced. Large parts of the project consisted of finding ways around those limitations. Maybe I'll do a Arduino Mega adaptation for more memory in the near future.

The wiring is as follows:
